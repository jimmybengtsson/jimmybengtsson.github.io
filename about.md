Hello! My name is Jimmy Bengtsson, and i'm 33 years old.

Born in Gothenburg, but now living in Halmstad with my fiance and son, who is 4 years old.
Currently a full time student at Linneaus University, studying web programming.


Some of my interests are:
 
- Photographing and editing photo & video content. Please visit [my photo-blog](https://www.jbpicture.com) if you want to see more.

- Mountainbiking - Mostly All-mountain (AM) and Downhill (DH).


On this blog I will post things related to my studies.
